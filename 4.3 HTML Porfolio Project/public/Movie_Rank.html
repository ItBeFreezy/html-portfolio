<h1>Tyler's Movie Opinions</h1>
<h2>My favorite movies to date.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The New Guy</h3>
<p>A raunchy comedy about a kid going to a new school after being released from jail. 90's/2000's were a<br/> 
different time.</p>
<h3>Any Studio Gibli Movie</h3>
<p>Just an overall amazing studio, their movies are masterpieces.</p>
<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
<p>An older movie about how the samurai culture was pushed out by the introduction of modern firearms<br />
not a happy ending to the movie but a great movie regardless.</p>
